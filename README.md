## Description

As part of the semester project, students are expected to create an e-commerce website with a customer-facing site and an admin section that enables users to edit, add, and delete products after logging in. Our choice of theme was up to us as long as it followed the site architecture, such as good user experience, UI design, following today's trends and design patterns, and to show what we have learned. Frontend requirements included a landing page, a product list, a product detail, and a cart page.
